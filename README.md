# SQL-Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of SQL projects I completed using **Google BigQuery**, demonstrating my skills in data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and end to end query workflows.

Each folder or file in this repo represents a different type of SQL task or concept I worked on.

## **🧹 1. Data Cleaning Queries**
These queries focus on preparing raw data for analysis.

**Skills shown:**
- Removing duplicates
- Normalizing inconsistent formats
- Handling missing data
- Standardizing values

**Example Files:**
- `remove_duplicates.sql`
- `clean_dates.sql`
- `standardize_columns.sql`

---

## **🔧 2. Data Transformation Queries**
These SQL scripts reshape the data into analyzable forms.

**Skills shown:**
- Joining multiple tables
- Creating calculated fields
- Filtering invalid entries
- Using CTEs (WITH clauses)

**Example Files:**
- `join_tables.sql`
- `create_features.sql`
- `transform_for_analysis.sql`

---

## **📊 3. Analysis Queries**
These represent final queries that generate insights.

**Skills shown:**
- Aggregation
- Trend analysis
- Summary statistics
- Grouping and window functions

** Files:**
- 1: `Analyzing_weather_data.sql`:
  ## Description:
  This SQL query retrieves weather data for La Guardia and JFK stations in 2020 and calculates the average temperature for June 2020.
  ## Dataset:
  This dataset was provided as part of a **hands-on activity in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. It is a public dataset that contains global summaries of the day (GSOD) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The GSOD dataset includes information about daily weather elements, such as mean temperature and wind speed, from more than 9,000 weather stations across the globe.
